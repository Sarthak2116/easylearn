Easy Learn is a web application which is made with the aim for helping the dyslexic children.

# Existing Design of the application.

The application has 4 stages, which are aimed at helping the children with different types of dylexia.

## Stage 0:

In this stage, we aim at making the child well aware of the UI, and help him/her with any kind of difficulty that he or she might face during accessing the application.

## Stage 1:

In this stage we monitor the vocabulary of the child. We throw random words at the child and ask him/her to pronounce the words. To move on to the next stage the child must correctly pronounce 10 words.

## Stage 2:

In this stage, we monitor the writing skills of the child. In this stage, the application says random words and the child is required to write down the words which he/she heard.

## Stage 3:

This stage tests the memory of the child. This stage contains the very famous flip the duo game.



After all the stages a report is generated for the child.
